# Changelog

All notable changes to the Icon Commerce College website project.

## [Unreleased]

### Phase 0.1 — Rebrand & cleanup (remove CIT + ad-tech)

First prompt of the Icon Commerce College rebuild (`prompts/01-rebrand-and-cleanup.md`).
Converts the CIT engineering-admissions boilerplate into a clean Icon Commerce
College foundation.

**Project metadata**
- Renamed package to `icon-commerce-college`; updated description, keywords, author.
- Rewrote `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` for the new multi-page college site + admin;
  both now point to `prompts/00-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` as the single source of truth.
- Reset `.env` / `.env.example` to Icon Commerce College contact info and lead
  defaults; removed all Meta/Google-Ads/conversion variables; added
  `REACT_APP_NOTICES_API_URL` and `REACT_APP_EVENTS_API_URL`; blanked GTM.

**Removed ad-tech stack (lean analytics decision)**
- Deleted `src/utils/metaPixel.js`, `metaCAPI.js`, `googleAds.js`,
  `enhancedConversions.js`, `gclidManager.js`, `consentMode.js`, `eventDedup.js`,
  and `src/admin/utils/googleAdsExport.js`.
- Deleted `public/api/meta-capi.php` and `public/api/google-offline-conversions.php`.
- Removed all imports/usages (App.jsx initializers, UnifiedLeadForm tracking,
  LeadDetail Meta-CAPI conversion feature, LeadManagement Google-Ads export).
- GTM (`gtm.js` / `useGTMTracking`) kept and now no-ops cleanly unless
  `REACT_APP_GTM_ID` + `REACT_APP_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` are set; the hardcoded GTM
  container snippet was removed from `index.html`.

**Removed CIT / engineering content**
- Deleted all CIT landing-page sections (`HeroSection`, `AboutSection`,
  `ServicesSection`, `StatsSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `LocationSection`,
  `CTASection`, `ContactSection`, `SecondaryCTASection`, `WhyChooseCIT`,
  `HighlightsSection`) — rebuilt fresh in Phase 2. The home route is now a
  minimal placeholder with an "Enquire Now" CTA.
- Deleted the unused legacy `LeadForm` wrapper and the CIT ad-tech admin
  **Guideline** module (`Guideline.jsx` + `guidelineContent/`) per the design doc.
- Emptied `src/data/*` content files to stubs (`export const x = []`), repopulated
  in prompt 03.

**Rebranded to Icon Commerce College (Navy + Gold, Gauhati University)**
- Header, Footer, MobileDrawer, MobileNavigation, ModalContext, LeadFormDrawer,
  UnifiedLeadForm, ThankYou, SEO config, theme/variables comments, `index.html`,
  `manifest.json`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and admin chrome
  (AdminLogin/AdminTopbar/Dashboard) now use Icon Commerce College branding,
  contact info, and a placeholder SVG logo
  (`/images/placeholders/logo-icon-commerce.svg`).
- Lead program options changed to B.Com / BBA / BCA / B.A.

**Known deferred items** (handled in later prompts): full Navy + Gold token
migration (prompt 02), multi-page routing (prompt 04), Header/Footer redesign
(prompts 05/06), college lead-form restructure (prompt 08), full SEO/schema
(prompt 10). The tele-calling admin module and the stale `CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md`
/ `GTM_GUIDE.md` are left for Phase 3 / prompt 39 respectively.


### Server-side leads as the single source of truth (cross-device sync fix)

**Fixed**
- Leads now sync correctly across every browser and device. The public form
  writes each submission directly to the shared server store
  (`public/api/leads.php`), and the admin panel reads/writes only the server
  (auto-refreshing every 15s). Previously leads were kept in per-browser
  `localStorage` and never reliably reached the server, so the admin panel
  showed different data on different devices.
- `webhookSubmit.js` now `POST`s straight to `/api/leads.php?action=create`
  and reports honest success/failure; the lead is no longer stored only in the
  submitting browser.
- Duplicate prevention is now server-side (by mobile number), so it works
  across devices instead of per-browser.

**Removed**
- **Pabbly Connect** integration entirely — webhook URL, `USE_PABBLY` /
  `DUMMY_MODE` flags, the admin Pabbly mirror (`REACT_APP_ADMIN_PABBLY_WEBHOOK_URL`),
  `adminConfig.js`, the Pabbly setup guide tab, and `PABBLY_GUIDE.md`.
- All `localStorage` use for lead data (`lp_submitted_leads` / `lp_test_leads`).
  Per-device essentials (admin login session, theme preference, Google Ads
  gclid attribution) still use `localStorage` by design.

**Notes**
- Meta Pixel / CAPI and Google Ads tracking are kept (env-driven, IDs blank —
  ready for CIT's own Pixel/Ads IDs). No third-party/other-client IDs remain.
- Added a "Lead Storage" tab to the admin Guideline page documenting the new
  architecture.
